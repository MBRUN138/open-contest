# OpenContest
OpenContest is an open-source programming contest management system written in Python. It allows judges to write problems and contest participants to submit solutions to those problems. 

## Basic Usage
To run OpenContest,
1. Install [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) on a Unix-based machine and start the daemon
2. Run `docker pull nathantheinventor/open-contest`
3. Run `docker run -v /tmp:/tmp -v /<db-path>:/db -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 0.0.0.0:8000:8000/tcp nathantheinventor/open-contest "<Yourname>" 8000`
4. Navigate to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and enter <Yourname> as the username and enter the password generated by OpenContest (visible in the logs)
5. Create problems, a contest to hold them, and users to participate

## Detailed Usage
OpenContest runs inside a Docker container and starts other containers on the host machine to run submissions. The explanation for the Docker flags used above is shown below:
```bash
docker run
    -v /tmp:/tmp # Maps the /tmp directory on the Docker image to the /tmp directory on the real machine
                 # This is needed for running the submitted code, since submissions are processed
                 # in the /tmp directory.
    -v /<db-path>:/db # Maps the path that you want to hold the database on the physical machine
                      # to the /db directory on the container.
                      # Allows the database to persist between runs of the container.
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock # Maps the Docker daemon socket to the image,
                                                 # allowing OpenContest to run submissions
                                                 # in Docker containers.
    -p 0.0.0.0:8000:8000/tcp # Maps port 8000 inside the container to port 8000 outside the container.
                             # You can change the IP so that OpenContest listens only on a particular
                             # network interface, and you can also change the port 
                             # on which OpenContest listens.
    nathantheinventor/open-contest # DockerHub address of the production version
    "<Yourname>" # The name of the first admin user. This user will be given admin rights,
                 # and a password will be generated and printed at the beginning of the log.
    8000 # Port number inside the container.
```

5. Enter the details of the problem. You may use Markdown formatting for the Problem Statement, Input Format, Output Format, and Constraints.  
    **Note**: The Description is the text shown under the problem title in the list of all problems.
6. After saving the problem details, create test data.
    - Click *Create Test Data*, enter input and output data, and click *Add Test Data*.
7. After creating the test data, set the number of sample cases and save the problem.

## Contest Information
OpenContest allows you to create multiple contests that run at different times. The most common use case for this feature is to allow for a practice round before an actual contest. To create a contest, go to Setup > Contest > Create Contest and enter the contest details. 

Before the contest begins, the problems page will show a countdown to the beginning of the contest, and after the last contest ends, the final leaderboard for the last will be visible.

## How to Print a Problem
OpenContest formats problems for printing so that you can print and distribute problem statement packets to contestants. To print a problem, go to the edit page for the problem, click *View Problem*, and print the page with Ctrl+P.

## How to Print the User Login Information
From the user list page, you can print the page with Ctrl+P for a list of usernames and passwords. You can then cut the paper and deliver these sheets to the contestants.

## Development Information
