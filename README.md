# OpenContest
OpenContest is an open-source programming contest management system written in Python.

## Basic Usage
To run OpenContest,
1. Install [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) and start the daemon
2. Run `docker pull nathantheinventor/open-contest`
3. Run `docker run -v /tmp:/tmp -v /<db-path>:/db -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 0.0.0.0:8000:8000/tcp nathantheinventor/open-contest "<Yourname>" 8000`
4. Navigate to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and enter <Yourname> as the username and the password generated by OpenContest (visible in the logs)
5. Create problems, a contest to hold them, and users to participate

## Detailed Usage
OpenContest runs inside a Docker container and starts other containers on the host machine to run submissions. The explanation for the Docker flags used above is shown below:
```bash
docker run
    -v /tmp:/tmp # Maps the /tmp directory on the Docker image to the /tmp directory on the real machine This is needed for running the submitted code, since submissions go into the /tmp directory.
    -v /<db-path>:/db # Maps the path that you want to hold the database on the physical machine to the /db directory on the container. Allows the database to persist between runs of the container.
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock # Maps the Docker daemon socket to the image, allowing OpenContest to run submissions in Docker containers.
    -p 0.0.0.0:8000:8000/tcp # Maps port 8000 inside the container to port 8000 outside the container. You can change the IP so that OpenContest listens only on a particular network interface, and you can also change the port that OpenContest listens on.
    nathantheinventor/open-contest # DockerHub address of the production version
    "<Yourname>" # The name of the first admin user. This user will be given admin rights, and a password will be printed at the beginning of the log.
    8000 # Port number inside the container.
```
